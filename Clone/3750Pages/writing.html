                <h1>The Unfolding Challenge of Information Privacy in the Data-Driven 21st Century <br><br></h1>

                <h2>The Era of Data and the Rise of Privacy Concerns</h2>
                <p>
                    The 21st century has ushered in an era defined by data. From social media interactions to online transactions, and from sophisticated AI algorithms to the ubiquitous Internet of Things, personal data is constantly being collected, processed, and analyzed. This unprecedented surge in data generation has fueled innovation and progress across various sectors, but it has also ignited a global challenge of immense proportions: information privacy.<br><br>
                    The ability to control how personal information is gathered, used, and shared has become a critical concern for individuals, organizations, and governments worldwide. Effectively protecting privacy in this data-driven landscape is not merely a matter of individual preference; it is a fundamental right with profound implications for societal well-being, economic stability, and the very fabric of democratic societies.

                <h2>Focusing on the Problem Space: Data Mining</h2>
                <p>
                    Diving deeper into the global challenge of information privacy, data mining will be the problem space of choice. By definition, “data mining is the process of sorting through large data sets to identify patterns and relationships that can help solve business problems through data analysis” (Gillis). Just about every company you interface with on the internet participates in data mining. For example, ads that you view on Youtube or other articles are targeted towards you and your preferences. By collecting and sorting through massive sets of data, ad companies can target their ads towards you. This paper will analyze ramifications of inadequate safeguards for the technology within data mining, ethical implications, and ideas for addressing/mitigating the effects and overcoming the challenges within the data mining industry.

                <h2>The Science of Data Mining: Collection and Sources</h2>
                <p>
                    First and foremost, we will address the science of data mining. The first step to data mining is collecting the data to be analyzed. This data is collected from a wide array of sources, depending on the specific goals and the nature of the data being sought. Organizations often gather data from their internal systems, such as transaction databases, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, and operational logs. External sources also play a significant role, including publicly available datasets, social media platforms, website analytics, sensor data from IoT devices, and data purchased from third-party providers. The collection process can involve various methods, such as manual data entry, automated data extraction through APIs, web scraping techniques to gather information from websites, and the use of specialized data collection tools and software.
                </p>

                <h2>Case Studies in Data Collection</h2>
                <h3>TikTok: A Prolific Data Collector</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest sources of data that people are familiar with is TikTok. This company is one of the worst offenders of data collection from individuals. If you actually read the privacy policy when signing up for the service, you would think twice about giving them your information. According to TikTok, here are some things that the platform collects; “Device Information. We collect certain information about the device you use to access the Platform, such as your IP address, user agent, mobile carrier, time zone settings, identifiers for advertising purposes, model of your device, the device system, network type, device IDs, your screen resolution and operating system, app and file names and types, keystroke patterns or rhythms, battery state, audio settings and connected audio devices. Location Data. We collect information about your approximate location, including location information based on your SIM card and/or IP address” (Privacy Policy).<br><br>
                    As a user of TikTok, this information is constantly being sent to the platform. With the amount of users that TikTok has, you can see why the United States has an issue with the platform being hosted in China. Information such as your IP address, mobile carrier, type of phone you have, even your battery life is all in a database somewhere. The data set available to sell is massive and probably takes up petabytes of storage. Location data, which is one of the more sensitive types of data, is collected by TikTok, too. Any user that interacts with TikTok, truly cannot have their privacy protected in the digital age.
                </p>

                <h3>The Automotive Industry: Connected Cars and Data Trails</h3>
                <p>
                    Another industry to look into is the automotive industry. Today, we have some of the most advanced vehicles in history. Looking just at the modern engine, it is full of sensors and modules to analyze every data point an engine can produce. Inside the car, you now see so many screens and buttons you may never even use. Many cars also contain cellular connectivity which allows for the company to always be connected to the car.<br><br>
                    Take a look at a Tesla vehicle. It is full of cameras and software to run every system. The car can even get software updates similar to a phone. Tesla also sends self driving data back to their servers in order to train better models for driving.<br><br>
                    Lately, a few companies have been investigated for taking data collected from drivers and selling it to data brokers. The FTC has started an investigation into GM/OnStar for selling users data to LexisNexis and associated data brokers for a profit (Nguyen). These brokers then sell this data to insurance companies which can deny people coverage and up their rates based on driving behavior linked to their vehicle. This practice, while technically not illegal, is highly frowned upon when it comes to privacy advocates.
                </p>

                <h2>The Data Brokerage Market and Consumer Impact</h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we will address how buying and selling of data can affect consumers. As mentioned before, data brokers are companies that specialize in collecting personal data about individuals from a wide variety of sources, often without the direct knowledge or consent of those individuals. These sources can include public records like census data and court documents, commercial sources such as purchase histories and loyalty programs, and online activities like social media and Browse behavior.<br><br>
                    Data brokers aggregate this information to create detailed profiles on millions of people, often compiling thousands of data points per individual. They then sell or license these profiles and segmented audiences to third parties, which can include marketing companies for targeted advertising, financial institutions for risk assessment, employers for background checks, and even government agencies. The business model of data brokers relies on the commodification of personal information, turning individuals into a product to be bought and sold in a largely unregulated market. The lack of regulation for this market is what is ultimately scary for individuals. This means that anything you interact with on the internet can be secretly collecting and selling this information without your consent. The harm is when it comes to profiling you for health and car insurance based on family history or driving history.

                <h2>Case Study: Toyota GR Corolla Warranty Denials</h2>
                <p>
                    One example of this practice in full effect is the denial of warranty claims by Toyota on a few different accounts. To set the stage, Toyota released a vehicle called the GR Corolla as a special edition of the normal Corolla. Like other modern vehicles, this car contains a modem which can send information back to Toyota.<br><br>
                    This story starts off with one owner named Bryan Banks driving his car down the interstate, when suddenly the vehicle catches fire. The fire department extinguished the fire and determined that the fire started in the engine bay. To the normal observer, this sounds like a defect in the engine that caused the vehicle to catch fire. While insurance covered most of the payoff of the car, the owner turned to Toyota to claim the rest of the money as the car was under warranty right? Well according to Toyota, this would be incorrect. Due to the car recording a speed of over 85 miles per hour, the warranty claim was denied. In a quote from Toyota, “The owner's manual warns not to drive [sic] in excess of the speed limit. Even if the legal speed limit permits it, do not drive over 85 mph unless your vehicle has high-speed capability tires. Driving over 85 mph may result in tire failure, loss of control and possible injury” (Smith). What is odd about this whole situation is this comes with a free track day for buying the car, due to the fact that it is a performance car, and that the tires it comes with are Michelin Pilot Sport tires which can go 186+ MPH. Toyota also claimed the vehicle went 114 MPH which was recorded by the vehicle's computer and this is “abuse of the vehicle”.<br><br>
                    In addition to this, another owner by the name of Sebastian had his vehicle also catch fire and burn to the ground. As one can assume, Toyota also denied their warranty claim, citing the same clause that was used against Banks. Due to the use of data collection practices that are not apparent to the user, warranty claims were denied due to data collected by the vehicle.

                <h2>Ramifications of Inadequate Safeguards in Data Mining</h2>
                <p>
                    Highlighted above, you can see some of the ramifications of inadequate safeguards when it comes to data mining. Warranty denial, insurance rate increases, and more are all effects of data mining.<br><br>
                    A primary concern to many is the violation of individual privacy, as sensitive personal information can be exposed, misused, or fall into the wrong hands. This can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, or reputational damage.<br><br>
                    Furthermore, the lack of robust security measures can make large datasets vulnerable to cyberattacks and data breaches, resulting in substantial financial losses for organizations through fines, legal fees, and damage to their reputation and customer trust.
                </p>
                <aside>
                    <h4>Check for Data Breaches</h4>
                    <p>A useful resource in this context is the website haveibeenpwned.com, which allows individuals to check if their email address has been compromised in known data breaches.</p>
                </aside>
                <p>
                    Another issue that arises from data mining is non-compliance with data protection regulations, such as GDPR or CCPA, due to insufficient safeguards that can result in severe legal penalties and further erode public trust.
                </p>

                <h2>Ethical Dimensions of Data Mining</h2>
                <p>
                    Ethical issues also arise when looking at data mining. One key concern revolves around privacy, as the analysis of large datasets can inadvertently reveal sensitive personal information, even when anonymization techniques are employed.<br><br>
                    Bias in the data is another significant challenge; if the data used for mining reflects existing societal biases, the resulting models can perpetuate and even amplify these inequalities, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes in areas like loan applications, hiring processes, or even criminal justice.<br><br>
                    Transparency and accountability are also crucial ethical considerations. Individuals often have little to no knowledge about how their data is being collected, processed, and used in data mining, making it difficult to understand the implications or exercise their rights. Furthermore, determining who is responsible when data mining leads to harm or unfair outcomes can be challenging.
                </p>

                <h2>A Kantian Perspective on Data Mining</h2>
                <p>
                    We can analyze data mining through the eyes of Kant. At the heart of Kantian ethics lies the categorical imperative, which dictates that we should act only according to principles that could become universal laws. Applying this principle to data mining, the widespread and undisclosed collection and analysis of personal data could be seen as problematic. Could we have a world where everyone's data is constantly mined without their knowledge or consent? Such a scenario could undermine individual autonomy and the very notion of privacy, potentially leading to a state where individuals are treated merely as means to an end rather than as ends in themselves, which violates another formulation of the categorical imperative.
                </p>

                <h2>Addressing the Challenges: The Path Forward for Data Mining</h2>
                <p>
                    When looking at the current practices behind data mining, it can be concluded that it needs to be changed in order to prioritize the privacy of the individual.<br><br>
                    Existing data protection laws need to be robustly enforced and potentially expanded to keep pace with the evolving capabilities of data mining. This could involve stricter rules around consent, limitations on the types of data that can be collected and processed, and significant penalties for non-compliance.<br><br>
                    Individuals should also have greater transparency regarding what data is being collected about them, how it is being used in data mining processes, and with whom it is being shared. This may include clear and accessible privacy policies, data dashboards that allow individuals to see and manage their data, and the ability to opt out of certain data collection or processing activities.<br><br>
                    Currently there are not many ways to protect yourself and your privacy. One service that exists is called DeleteMe and you pay them to find and delete your data. This service can be effective at deleting your information from brokers, however it cannot delete all of your data. Data mining will only become bigger and more problematic as the internet grows. It is important to inform yourself on the subject and protect yourself from this unregulated practice.
